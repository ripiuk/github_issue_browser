            <blockquote>GitHub.com was a start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.
                In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100M in venture capital. In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250M of venture capital in a series B round.
                Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and other venture capital funds.
                As of August 2016, GitHub was making $140M in Annual Recurring Revenue.</blockquote>
            <p>GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).
                Employees can choose to work on projects that interest them (open allocation). However, salaries are set by the chief executive.</p>
